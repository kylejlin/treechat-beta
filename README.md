# treechat

An alternative chatting system.

## What is treechat?

Traditional chatting systems are linear and chronologically ordered. That is, each new comment is a child of the *most recent* existing comment.

In treechat, every new comment is a child of an existing comment, however, the parent comment can be *any* comment, not just the most recent one.

## Why treechat?

While abandoning the traditional linear system in favor of a tree-like system sacrifices some simplicity, it allows users to give make the context of their comments explicit.
